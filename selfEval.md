1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel confident, I did not feel like I had to research to deepen my understanding.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I feel confident. I had to complete a little bit of reaserch to understand why the number 1 was showing up when comparing the dog loves to play and was a pupy. The explanation I found cleared things up for me.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I feel confident in my use of it. I can see this gettign more and more complicated if more conditions are added. But the conditions in the excersises wre straight forward. 
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
This lesson took me 2 hours to complete. Moreless what I expected. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I mostly need to keep practicing to ensure I have the syntax memorised. Most errors I had were minor syntax errors. I can complete the additional challenge excercises when I get a chance. 
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I would like to confirm if there is an easier way to complete if statements when there are a lot of different conditions. This is something can google if it's not covered in the mod 0 curiculum.
